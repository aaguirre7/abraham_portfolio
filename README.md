<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Challange 

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](./assets/images/screenshot.png)

### The Task:

A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point canâ€™t be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies.

### Criteria:

- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
- THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
- THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
- THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
- THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
- THEN I am taken to that deployed application
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
- THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

### What was done.
